# montereyYachtLending
Lending page, made to promote a motor yacht Monterey Cruiser 322.
But it didnt get to the production due to all this quarantine/virus situation. 

The main idea of this project was to insert the real elements of the yacht deck into the page design. 
I use the real photos from the yacht to make the style of the deck hatch frame and bullet points.

And from a developer's point of view, a very interesting part for me was the slider picture gallery. I decided not to take some ready one and made it from the scratch.
- It is fully adaptive and looks good on the different screen sizes.
- Adjusts well and didn't lose the position of the current frame when the screen size is changing. 
- Shift to the next frame can be made by the click on the screen buttons, keyboard left/right arrows, mouse drag, swipe on the touch screen.

Also, the page shows good results at the Google Lighthouse test.
